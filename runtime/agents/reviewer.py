"""
ReviewerAgent — Self-improving post-task learner for OpenSarthi.

After every task run (success or failure), the Reviewer analyses the execution log
and writes concrete, actionable lessons to long-term memory.  These lessons are
auto-injected into the planner context on the next similar task, progressively
making the agent smarter over time.

Runs as a fire-and-forget asyncio task — never blocks the user response.

Analyse this completed task and extract 1–3 reusable lessons for future tasks.

TASK GOAL: {goal[:200]}

EXECUTION LOG:
{chr(10).join(log_summary)}

FINAL OUTCOME: {outcome[:200]}

Extract ONLY lessons that are:
- Specific and actionable (not generic advice)
- About tool usage, timing, app behaviour, or UI quirks on Linux
- Things that would genuinely help next time

OUTPUT FORMAT — JSON array of strings (or empty array if no lesson):
["lesson 1", "lesson 2"]

Examples of good lessons:
- "Firefox address bar: click → Ctrl+L to select all → type URL → press Enter"
- "Dolphin file manager: always wait 1500ms after opening before clicking files"
- "YouTube volume slider: use keyboard (up/down arrow keys) — mouse drag unreliable"
- "Leafpad text editor app name on Garuda Linux is 'mousepad', not 'leafpad'"
